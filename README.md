# WT Extras
A website designed for easily browsing volume extras for a manga series using series of dropdowns. 


I made this website because reading the volume extras/databook pages and learning the lore around the series was super rewarding and enjoyable for me, and I wanted to make it easier for other people to browse and enjoy. I tried to categorize the information thoughtfully, not only to make it easy to use and find what you're looking for, but also to inspire further exploration.
